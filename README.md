This is just for reference. Consider it outdated, deprecated, unsupported and so on.

For the time being this is just me trying to get this wow.export (https://github.com/Kruithne/wow.export) to Unity importer made by Ryan Zehm to work, ref. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xo3Bo04wCI

It requires a specific, modified version of wow.export that is available in the description of the above video. Ryan Zehm's version of wow.export is modified to output splat maps suitable for Unity terrain, and there may be other modifications I'm not aware of, but that seems to be the main one at least. And that seems to be the prerequisite for this entire importer to work.

# wow.unity

There is also this much more robust and promising wow.export to Unity project by Breanna Jones: https://github.com/briochie/wow.unity  
But it imports the terrain as tons of individual meshes, at least currently, which is why I wanted a working copy of Ryan's importer as a reference.

# Why?

My motivation for spending time on any of this is that I want to make a protoype/game hobby project in Unity with gameplay similar to World of Warcraft, but it looking exactly like World of Warcraft is in no way a requirement. It's only if I end up saving time by using existing WoW assets that I will bother with any of this. And as primarily a designer/programmer it's motivating to have high quality ready-made and compatible assets to choose from, so that I only have to focus on the actual game design, which is the part I enjoy. WoW also still look extremely nice to this day. At least the Classic versions.
